# 🐍 OOP & Error Handling Adventure – Week 3 Projects!

Welcome to the ultimate **Python OOP + Error Handling** playground! 🎢  
This repo features **three mini projects** that combine the power of **Object-Oriented Programming**, user interaction, and **exception handling** – all in a fun, beginner-friendly way! 😄

---

## 1️⃣ Square Root Checker 🔢💥

### 📌 Description:
This program helps users calculate the **square root of a positive number**. It includes error handling for non-numeric input, negative numbers, and zero input, ensuring robust user interaction.

### 💡 Features:
- Input validation (must be a number)
- Exception handling for:
  - Non-numeric input
  - Negative numbers ❌
  - Zero (not allowed!) ⛔
- Square root calculation using `math.sqrt`

---

## 2️⃣ To-Do List Manager 📝✅

### 📌 Description:
This interactive console app helps users **add, remove, and view tasks** in a to-do list. It utilizes exception handling to provide a smooth user experience.

### 💡 Features:
- Interactive menu: add, delete, view, exit
- Input validation & exception handling:
  - Empty input when adding tasks ⚠️
  - Invalid task number when deleting ❗
  - Graceful handling of empty list situations 🗑️

## 3️⃣ Zoo Management System 🦁🐘🐧

### 📌 Description:
This OOP-based program lets users manage different types of animals in a zoo using **abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism**. Includes full exception handling for invalid animal data.

### 💡 OOP Concepts Used:
- 🧬 **Abstraction**: `Animal` is an abstract class
- 🔐 **Encapsulation**: Animal data is private
- 🧬 **Inheritance**: `Lion`, `Elephant`, `Penguin`, and `Dog` inherit from `Animal`
- 🎭 **Polymorphism**: Each animal has its own `make_sound()` method

### 🚨 Exception Handling:
- Empty name? ❌ Raises error!
- Negative age? ❌ Error!
- Not an instance of `Animal`? ❌ Yup, error again!

## 🚀 How to Run
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed, then run each file:

```bash
python "Number 1.py"  # Square Root Checker
python "Number 2.py"  # To-Do List Manager
python "Number 3.py"  # Zoo Management System
```
