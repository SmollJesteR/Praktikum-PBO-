# 🤖 Robot Battle Game

A simple turn-based RPG-style robot battle game built in Python. This project features a player-controlled robot battling against an AI-controlled robot with mechanics such as attack accuracy, evasion, defense, and stun effects.

## 🎮 How to Play
1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. The game will start with two robots facing off.
3. Each round, both robots take turns choosing an action:
   - `1. Attack` – Attempt to damage the opponent.
   - `2. Defense` – Reduce incoming damage.
   - `3. Self Destruct` – Forfeit the match, giving victory to the opponent.
4. The game continues until one robot's HP reaches 0 or a player chooses to self-destruct.
5. The winner is announced at the end.

## 🛠 Features
✅ **Turn-Based Combat** – Players take turns selecting actions.
✅ **AI-Controlled Opponent** – The second robot chooses actions randomly.
✅ **Attack Accuracy & Evasion** – Attacks can miss or be dodged.
✅ **Stun Mechanic** – Small chance to stun an opponent.
✅ **Health Regeneration** – Players can restore HP.

## 🔧 Requirements
- Python 3.x

## 🚀 Running the Game
